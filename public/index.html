        Block off your calendar because the next Barnett Family Reunion is coming up.
      </p>
      <h2>When</h2>
      <p>
        The reunion is tentatively scheduled for June 2019.
      </p>
      <h2>Where</h2>
      <p>
        San Antonio, Texas. It is about a 14 hour drive from Phoenix.
        The exact venue is still being decided.
      </p>
      <h2>Funding</h2>
      <p>
        The fund raisers help to offset out of pocket costs from each of us. The
        proceeds we raise from the fund raisers will be combined with our $250 per family commitment to pay
        for the reunion expenses, i.e., banquet, T-shirts, welcoming bags, dinner Friday or Saturday or both days,
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the $250 per household, it is of the utmost importance that each household please be vigilant
        in paying. If you require a payment plan, we ask that you please pay a minimum of $25 per month until
        paid in full.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Deadline for paying the $250 per household is June 1, 2018.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2>Banquet</h2>
      <p>
        Another topic we would like to begin addressing is the dress code for the banquet. The banquet is a
        wonderful gathering for our family to bring our reunion to a close. We want everyone of course, to be
        comfortable in mind and appearance. So, with respect, we are asking everyone to dress in semi-formal
        attire for the banquet. That translates to attire that you would not wear to a picnic or a ball game, but
        rather attire that is appropriate for an evening dinner (men: suit or dress slacks, dress shirt and tie /
        women: dress or dressy suit). The dress code for the banquet will continue to be firmly emphasized.
        We want everyone's participation, but even more so, your cooperation. Thank you.
